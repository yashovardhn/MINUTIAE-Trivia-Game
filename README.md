# Trivia-app
There are a variety of trivia game iOS apps in App Store. Those apps have great features and
functionalities to satisfy users. However, according to my research, only a few of them have
friendly user interface and human centred interactions, which means that a lot of them might be
difficult to be navigated even though they provide enough functionalities. It is not convenient
for new users.
Quiz Contest is an iOS application that has general questions related to current afairs and
computer or according to the api set for the questions. It has multiple choice questions with
time limit and it also calculate scores of each correct answer. It is good for students of every
age group it helps in increasing general knowledge about world ,Sports and computer etc. Don't
need register simply give any user name and password it will saved automatically and you can
login again with same user name and password donâ€™t have to worry about the past score. The
application helps the user to increase his/her knowledge. Since Smartphone mobiles are being
widely used by general population and students, the Quiz Contest application can provide on
the Student's mobile.
